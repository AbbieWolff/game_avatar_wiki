    <h3>Case Study: Presence & Agency</h3>

            When a player is highly immersed in a virtual world, it is possible to create confusion about
            agency for actions taken by an avatar, after which the player is left to wonder whether they
            instigated and caused an action of the avatar or not.<sup><a href="#Twilley">1</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            A University of Barcelona study examined this phenomenon by making participants feel
            as though they had body ownership of an avatar.

        <div class="panel-body">
            With a combination of motion sensing the participants and subsequent movement replication by
            the avatar, participants were led to believe that the 3D
            avatar they viewed in a virtual mirror was a reflection of their own body. The avatar then said
            "casa" (the Spanish word for home/house), with accompanying vibrations partcipants' vocal chords.

        <div class="panel-body">
            The participant could not determine whether they chose to speak the word or whether
            the avatar spoke the word of its own accord. This was the intention of the researchers, to create
            identity and agency confusion.
            <br/><br/>
            These results have definite social implications and signal some promising--and frightening--future
            uses of virtual reality and avatars.
            <br/><br/>
            This technology can demonstrably, at least in specific
            situations in university laboratories, offer an opportunity for players/participants to
            swap selves and explore other identities almost literally. Internal racism, sexism,
            self-esteem, and many other social issues and psychological problems can be, at least temporarily,
            lessened through virtual reality identity exploration. <sup><a href="#Twilley">1</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            This illusion of body ownership can lead to negative psychological effects and sometimes
            emotional suffering if participants/players are led to feel ownership for actions they did not
            choose and/or did not agree to perform.
