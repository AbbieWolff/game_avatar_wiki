            Primarily, anonymity has to do with whether the player feels anonymous.
            There are many ways a player could potentially be identified (for
            example, since her activity is tied to an IP address); however, the technical
            sophistication of the user affects her feeling of anonymity.
            <br/><br/>
            Players may not feel anonymous if:

            <ul>
                <li>They have <a href="PersistentIdentity.html">persistent identities</a>
                    within or across virtual worlds and game sites</li>
                <li>go by their real name online</li>
                <li>otherwise identify themselves publicly in a way
                    that connects to their real-world</li>
                <li>create an avatar that <a href="AvatarAppearance.html">looks</a> like them
                    <sup><a href="#Midha">1</a></sup></li>

            Anonymous avatars are often used by players as a means of identity
            exploration—especially by gamers who identify with the LGBTQ+<sup><a>?</a></sup>
            community.<sup><a href="#Crowson">2</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            Online anonymity provides an opportunity for players to try on new identities
            that they may not be comfortable exploring offline, while avoiding real-world *social
            consequences*.
            <br/><br/>
            Escaping from their offline identities also allows players to explore, and,
            eventually, understand and accept themselves. Online communities can facilitate identity
            demarginalization through greater self-acceptance, decreased estrangement from society and
            reduction of social isolation. <sup><a href="#Crowson">2</a></sup>

            Most visitors to the comment sections of certain websites (like YouTube) and online games
            (like <i>Call of Duty</i>) can attest to this dark side of anonymity.
            <br/><br/>
            Anonymity can cause problems during virtual teamwork. Research shows that virtual
            teams work better, in general, when members are identifiable, not anonymous.
            Virtual teams report less social loafing and more credibility and accountability when the
            team members’ avatars are identifiable.<sup><a href="#Midha">1</a></sup>

            Similarly, anonymous users can be more likely to engage in <a href="Harassment.html">harassment</a>
            or otherwise misbehave in virtual environments. Anonymous players don't care about
