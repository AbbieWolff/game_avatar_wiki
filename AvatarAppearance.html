            Players usually care a great deal about their avatarâ€™s appearance.
            <br/><br/>
            They often spend hours carefully creating avatars, selecting their gender, age, ethnicity, clothing, accessories and more stylistic considerations, to present their desired image in games.
            <br/><br/>
            As with real-world personal style preferences and motivations for *self-representation and impression management*, gamers have specific motivations for their avatar appearance choices.

            Researchers found that player motivations for avatar creation could be grouped into four categories<sup><a href="#Lin">2</a></sup>:
            <ul>
                <li> <i>virtual exploration</i>, taking advantage of the digital, immersive environments to do things otherwise impossible or difficult;</li>
                <li> <i>social navigation</i>, maneuvering the social dynamic in these complex worlds to make friends and build reputation;</li>
                <li> <i>contextual adaptation</i>, adjusting and responding to the socio-cultural contexts;</li>
                <li> and <i>identity representation</i>, portraying either the actual or the ideal self.</li>

            Players often choose to play as opposite-gender avatars during avatar creation.
            <br/><br/>
            One study found that 23% of male players and 7% of female players chose opposite-gender avatars.<sup><a href="#Concordia">1</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            Male players with female avatars used more emotional phrases and emoticons than male players with same-gender avatars. They also moved their avatars backwards and jumped more often than female players playing female avatars did.<sup><a href="#Concordia">1</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            These behaviors show that men reinforce idealized notions of feminine appearance and communication while playing as female avatars.<sup><a href="#Concordia">1</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            Thus, selecting avatar gender may be less a matter of identity expression, and more a strategic selection of available multi-modal codes that players take up in their navigation of this digital space.<sup><a href="#Concordia">1</a></sup>
