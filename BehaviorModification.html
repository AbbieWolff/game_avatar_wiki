            Virtual environments provide an excellent opportunity to motivate users to make in-game and real-world behavioral changes.
            <br/><br/>
            In-game *immersion* influences the likelihood influences of making positive behavioral changes to their real-life appearance, exercise, or diet and/or their satisfaction with the in-game relationships they developed with other players. They found that designing and identifying with an avatar in a virtual world like <i>Second Life</> can have positive results upon players’ real-world behaviors (Behm-Morawitz, 2013).
            <br/><br/>
            Researchers found that Chinese gamers had positive online social capital benefits, a.k.a. more bonding with fellow gamers, but little real world social capital effects from their collective play. (Zhong, 2011).
            <br/><br/>
            Collective play also demonstrably increased players' online activism/civic engagement. Practicing social skills and forming and maintaining relationships online through collective play helped them develop the confidence to participate in online civic activities. (Zhong, 2011).

            Donning a head-mounted display and becoming *immersed* in a 3D virtual world offers a unique experience for users.
            <br/><br/>
            For instance, researchers at Southern Methodist University are using *virtual reality* training  to prevent sexual harassment, assault, and rape. This is done by offering young women an opportunity to practice assertiveness in saying “no” to unwanted sexual advances. (CBS DFW, 2015).
            <br/><br/>
            While the researchers acknowledge that the primary responsibility for sexual assault lies firmly on the assailant, not the victim, they hope that this training will prevent some women from being assaulted. (CBS DFW, 2015).

            Virtual worlds like <i>Second Life</i> have become new frontiers for *virtual therapy* for patients with a range of psychological issues, such as addiction, anxiety, PTSD, depression, and body image. (Mollman, 2008; Kim & Sundar, 2012).
