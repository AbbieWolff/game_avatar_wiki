            With such amazing possibilities for immersive gaming experiences available today,
            the importance of having avatars that players can relate to cannot be understated.
            Yet, the current state of video game diversity representation sorely needs improvement.

            In a broad, representative survey released before 2009, researchers at USC discovered that:
            <sup><a href="USC">1</a></sup>

            <ul>
                <li>Less than 3% were Hispanic/Latino, none of whom were playable/central characters.</li>
                <li>only 10 percent of playable characters surveyed were female, though women
                    now make up 40 percent of video game players.
                </li>
                <li>Native Americans, children, and the elderly were also underrepresented.</li>
                <li>Males, whites and adults were over-represented. </li>

            Pearson discussed the social and societal implications of
            Stanford's research finding that participants with male avatars
            performed better on math tests than those with female avatars, regardless of their
            biological gender in real life. <sup><a href="#Pearson">5</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            These, and other study findings, illustrate the carryover of sexism and
            stereotypes into virtual worlds. Pearson encouraged readers and researchers to
            examine virtual realms as a potential source of examination and exploration of new ways of
            looking at gender. Gender is just another mask we put on in real life.
            <sup><a href="#Pearson">6</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            This could discourage underrepresented players, especially those who are
            girls/women and/or who are from a Latino background, from pursuing a career in
            game-making and other STEM fields.<sup><a href="#USC">1</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            This lack of representation in video games has <a>demonstrable effects</a>
            on players of all genders, sexual orientations and racial backgrounds.
