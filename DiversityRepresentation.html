    <h3>Diversity Representation</h3>

            With such amazing possibilities for immersive gaming experiences available today, the importance of having avatars that players can relate to cannot be understated. 
            <br/><br/>
            Yet, the current state of video game diversity representation sorely needs improvement. <sup><a href="#USC">1</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Pearson">2</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Lee">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Jacobs">4</a></sup> <sup><a href="#Kamp">5</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            In a broad, representative survey of the gender and race of video game characters in games released before 2009, researchers discovered that<sup><a href="#USC">1</a></sup>:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <i>Less than 3%</i> were Hispanic/Latino, none of whom were playable/central characters.
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Women, Native Americans, children and the elderly also were underrepresented. For example, only 10 percent of playable characters surveyed were female, though women now make up 40 percent of video game players."
                </li>
                <li>
                    "Males, whites and adults were over-represented."
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br/><br/>
            This could discourage underrepresented players, especially those who are girls/women and/or who are from a Latino background, from pursuing a career in game-making and other STEM fields.<sup><a href="#USC">1</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            This lack of representation in video games has demonstrable effects on players of all genders, sexual orientations and racial backgrounds.

                Virtual realms offer an opportunity to explore how we look at gender--gender is just another mask we put on in real life.<sup><a href="#Pearson">2</a></sup>
