            The extent to which video game players psychologically identify with their avatars.
            <br/><br/>
            Players who psychologically identify with their avatars project some aspects of their real-life,
            persistent identity onto avatars while playing video games.
            <br/><br/>
            The likelihood of identifying with an avatar can be increased by presence of four distinct
            factors
            <sup><a href="#Identification">1</a></sup>
            <ul>
                <li>Emotional involvement</li>
                <li><a class="keyword" href="Immersion.html"> Immersion/presence</a></li>
                <li>Positive attitude toward the avatar</li>
                <li>Importance of avatar to identity</li>

        <div class="panel-body">
            If a player doesn't identify with their avatar, it is harder for them to be
            <a href="Immersion.html" class="keyword">immersed </a> in the game. This is partly because
            players won't care what happens to the avatar. <sup><a href="#PyschologicalFunctions">2</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            In addition, players won't take their in-game actions seriously, because they do not feel that
            their avatar's actions are representative of themselves.
            <br/><br/>
            When a player feels attached to their avatar, they're more likely to use the avatar as an
            extension of their <a>persistent identity</a>.
            <br/>
            Creating and controlling avatars allows players to explore alternate identities in
            virtual environments, and to reap the benefits of that exploration.
            This identity exploration can offer “reverse enhancement” benefits, or
            rather <a>modify their behavior</a> in the real world real-world.

            When game avatars are complex characters with distinct personalities
            (as in games like <i>Neverwinter Nights II</i><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neverwinter_Nights_2">?</a></sup>),
            rather than mostly blank slates
            (as in games like <i>World of Warcraft</i><sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_of_Warcraft">?</a></sup>), players still identify with their avatars.
            <br/><br/>
            Surprisingly, players seemed equally, if not more,
            engaged by complex avatar characters with predefined personalities (regardless of the specific
            personality or likability of those characters) than in previous studies.<sup><a href="#CharacterPlay">3</a></sup>
