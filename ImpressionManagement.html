        <div class="panel-body">
            As in real life, players in virtual worlds manage how they represent themselves and the impressions they make on other people through strategic choices in <a class="keyword" href="AvatarAppearance.html">avatar appearance</a> and behavior.
            <br/><br/>
            <a class="keyword" href="SocialNorms.html">Social norms</a> can strongly influence the most common methods and styles of self-representation and impression management. Harmful social norms, such as harassment, can also influence the ways that players choose to self-represent.
            <br/><br/>
            In addition to the avatar’s appearance, virtual goods/accessories can be part of the image people present. However, *anonymity* and <a class="keyword" href="Immersion.html">immersion</a> impact the perceived emotional and social value of the decorative virtual goods.<sup><a href="#Shang">1</a></sup>

        <div class="panel-body">
          Some players are self-aware of their impression management strategies.
          <br/><br/>
          As a result of this self-awareness, participants sometimes reject their own attempts to strategically self-represent, opting to instead deliberately attempt to self-represent accurately. However, most players maintain at least slight exaggeration of reality in favor of impression management. Some even take on extremely different identities.<sup><a href="#Vasalou">3</a></sup>
          <br/><br/>
          Players are also self-aware of <a class="keyword" href="Identification.html">identifying with their avatars></a> and express similarity to their avatars.<sup><a href="#Vasalou">3</a></sup>
          <br/><br/>
          To some, this could be seen as a form of deception.<sup><a href="#Hooi">2</a></sup>
          <br/><br/>
          It is very common for players to make their avatars appear more attractive than they may actually think they are in real life. Whether this ‘improvement’ is deceptive or not is up for debate.<sup><a href="#Hooi">2</a></sup>
