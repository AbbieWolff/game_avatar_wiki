        <div class="panel-heading">Definition </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            As in real life, players in virtual worlds manage how they represent themselves
            to other people through strategic choices in
            <a class="keyword" href="AvatarAppearance.html">avatar appearance</a> and behavior.
            <br/><br/>
            <a class="keyword" href="SocialNorms.html">Social norms</a>
            can strongly influence the most common methods and styles of
            self-representation and impression management. Harmful social norms, such as
            <a>harassment</a>, can also influence the ways that players choose to self-represent.
            <br/><br/>
            In addition to the avatar’s appearance, virtual goods/accessories
            can be part of the image people present. However,
            <a>anonymity</a> and <a class="keyword" href="Immersion.html">immersion</a>
            impact the perceived emotional and social value of the decorative
            virtual goods.<sup><a href="#Shang">1</a></sup>

        <div class="panel-body">
            Some players consciously manage their impressions on others.
            <br/><br/>
            Sometimes, participants opt to represent themselves accurately,
            both in their behavior and their
            <a class="keyword" href="AvatarAppearance.html">avatar's appearance </a>.
            However, most players maintain at least slight exaggeration of reality in
            favor of representing themselves better. Some even take on extremely different
            identities.<sup><a href="#Vasalou">2</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            Since people are not always representing themselves accurately,
            some see this as a form of deception.<sup><a href="#Hooi">3</a></sup>
            Whether these improvements are truly more deceptive than real life self-representation
            is up for debate.<sup><a href="#Hooi">3</a></sup>

        <div class="panel-heading">Avatar Similarity</div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            Players with avatars that share some visual similarity
            with other members of their virtual social group can experience positive effects from
            that similarity, including<sup><a href="#Hooi">3</a></sup>:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Heightened self-awareness

    <div class="panel panel-default col-md-5 col-md-offset-1">
        <div class="panel-heading">Age, Ethnicity, & Gender Disclosure</div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            In <a class="keyword" href="VirtualReality.html">virtual realities</a>, it is much easier to hide
            one’s identity by choosing avatars who appear the way players want to be seen, even if it is not
            <a class="keyword" href="AvatarAppearance.html">similar</a> to the way they actually look
            in real life.
            <br/><br/>
            However, disclosing one’s real age, ethnicity and gender, especially when players’ are a minority group,
            can be fraught with social risks, even in
            virtual worlds.<sup><a href="#Lee">4</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            As in real-world social situations, some gamers are cruel to players from minority groups by
            engaging in rassment, ostracism, and/or microaggressions in-game.<sup><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microaggression_theory">?</a></sup>
            These behaviors are often motivated by internal racism, sexism, ageism, etc. or because they are
            <a href="SocialNorms">social norms</a> in the group.
            <br/><br/>
            As a result, gamers who identify as female or genderqueer, who are from ethnic minorities,
            and/or who are older than the majority of other players may hesitate to disclose these
            details.<sup><a href="#Martey">5</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            Virtual worlds that provide more equitable <a>diversity representation</a> than the current norm can
            create a safer environment for players who may otherwise hesitate to disclose such traits.
