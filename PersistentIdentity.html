            <i>Persistent identity</i> defines how a person usually represents him/herself.
            It includes personality traits, preferences and opinions, typical patterns of behavior,
            and everything else that makes up what people think of as their identity.
            <br/><br/>
            Persistent identity is, in other words, "a fixed set of identifiers...associated with a
            person so that he/she can be recognized or distinguished by others and by society in general."<sup><a href="#Gilbert">1</a></sup>

            In virtual worlds, players have the opportunity to create many different alternate identities
            -- each represented by a unique avatar.
            <br/><br/>
            It is necessary for both psychological well-being and relationship formation in virtual
            worlds to maintain a persistent primary identity that people recognize and
            associate with an avatar.<sup><a href="#Gilbert">1</a></sup>
            Generally, it's not socially acceptable to drastically change how a player represents him/herself.
            <br/><br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>To prevent players from re-experiencing the uncomfortable sensation of identity confusion that almost everyone endures during adolescence.                </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>In social situations in virtual worlds, to distinguish between who one actually is and who one is presenting as while playing each avatar. Without this distinction between who a player is and who/what they are playing as, it is hard to engender trust and thus to form social relationships.<sup><a href="Gilbert">2</a></sup>

            Players project some aspects of their persistent identities onto their avatars in social
            virtual environments.
            <br/><br/>
            Players with high levels of agreeableness on personality measurements were more likely to direct
            their avatars to engage in pro-social behaviors in Massively Multiplayer Online Games (MMOGs)
            than players with low levels of measured agreeableness.<sup><a href="#McCreery 2012">2</a></sup>
            <sup><a href="#McCreery 2013">3</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            <i>Agreeableness</i> is defined as the “interpersonal tendencies related to self-interest,
            concern for others, and social harmony".<sup><a href="#McCreery 2012">4</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            Along the same <i>Big Five</i> personality measure, players with high levels of introversion and
            neuroticism--especially those with low self-esteem--create avatars that
            <a>visually differ</a> more from their own physical characteristics than players with
            high self-esteem.
            <br/>
            Arguably, this is done to <a>manage others’ impressions </a> by making their avatar's
            <a href="ProteusEffect.html" class="keyword">behavior appear</a> more
            extroverted, less neurotic, and more confident.<sup><a href="#Dunn">1</a></sup>
