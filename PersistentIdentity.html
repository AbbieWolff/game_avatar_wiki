    <h3>Persistent Identity</h3>

        <div class="panel-body">
            While exploring alternate identities with avatars in virtual worlds, players maintain a stable persistent identity.
            <br/><br/>
            <i>Persistent identity</i> defines who a person is, most of the time and in all facets of life. It includes personality traits, preferences and opinions, typical patterns of behavior, and everything else that makes people who they are, at their core, in their stable self-concept and identity.
            <br/><br/>
            Persistent identity is, in other words, "a fixed set of identifiers are associated with a person so that he/she can be recognized or distinguished by others and by society in general."<sup><a href="#Gilbert">2</a></sup>

        <div class="panel-heading"> Importance </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            In virtual worlds, players have the opportunity to create many different alternate identities--each represented by a unique avatar. Yet, each of these alternate identities controlled by the player fundamentally represent that player and are controlled by her/him.
            <br/><br/>
            It is necessary for both psychological well-being and relationship formation in virtual worlds to maintain a persistent identity that presides over all of a player’s avatars.<sup><a href="#Gilbert">2</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
                <ul>
                    <li>To prevent players from re-experiencing the uncomfortable sensation of identity confusion that almost everyone endures during adolescence.                </li>
                    </li>
                    <li>In social situations in virtual worlds, to distinguish between who one actually is and who one is presenting as while playing each avatar. Without this distinction between who a player is and who/what they are playing as, it is hard to engender trust and thus to form social relationships.<sup><a href="Gilbert">2</a></sup>

              Players project some aspects of their persistent identities onto their avatars in social virtual environments.
              <br/><br/>
              Players with high levels of agreeableness on personality measurements were more likely to direct their avatars to engage in pro-social behaviors in MMOGs (Massively Multiplayer Online Games) than players with low levels of measured agreeableness.<sup><a href="#McCreery 2012">3</a></sup> <sup><a href="#McCreery 2013">4</a></sup>
              <br/><br/>
              <i>Agreeableness</i> is “interpersonal tendencies related to self-interest, concern for others, and social harmony".<sup><a href="#McCreery 2012">3</a></sup>
              <br/><br/>
              Along the same <i>Big Five</i> personality measure, players with high levels of introversion and neuroticism--especially those with low self-esteem--create avatars that visually differ more from their own physical characteristics than players with high self-esteem in ways that manage others’ impressions by making their avatars appear more extroverted, less neurotic and more confident.<sup><a href="#Dunn">1</a></sup>
