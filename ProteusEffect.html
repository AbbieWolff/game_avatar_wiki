            <i>The Proteus Effect</i> occurs when avatar appearance leads to behavior change.
            <br/><br/>
            Researchers believe it is due to *immersiveness* of interactive *virtual reality*
            (e.g. games), rather than passive representations (e.g. films or books) that causes the Proteus
            Effect to flourish.

        <div class="panel-heading"> Behavior Modification </div>
        <div class="panel-body">
            There are numerous examples of *behavior change* motivated by *avatar appearance* in the research
            literature on avatars.
            <br/><br/>
            For instance, seeing a virtual representation of oneself exercising can motivate players to
            exercise themselves, in real-life. <sup><a href="#Fox">2</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            Therapists have found that the Proteus Effect increases the effectiveness of *virtual reality
            therapy* with patients struggling with body dissatisfaction, substance abuse issues, and more.

        <div class="panel-body">
            When playersâ€™ avatars appear possess characteristics that players see as desirable, they behave
            differently in communication with others in virtual worlds.
            <br/><br/>
            The height and attractiveness of players' avatars influences their behavior, in that players with taller
            avatars behave in a more dominant manner.
            <br/>Conversely, players with shorter avatars behave in a more submissive manner.<sup><a href="#Biever">1</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            Similarly, players who perceived their avatars as less attractive than others' stood farther away from other avatars in conversation than their more attractive peers did.
