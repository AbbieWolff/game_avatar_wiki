        <div class="panel-body">
             A study on the interaction between player gender, avatar gender and social communication and behavior in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) video games found that<sup><a href="#Dunn">1</a></sup>:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Women actually played more hours and more characters than men did.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Women experience sexism within the virtual world.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Women perceive that such games are “made” for men....
                </li>
                <li>
                    Men often assume all other players are also men unless proven otherwise. However, female players who do convince the male counterpart of her gender face further discrimination.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Male players often will downplay females’ abilities or engage in courtship.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Much in the same way that men gender-bend to receive assistance, <em>women sometimes report gender-bending to avoid the simple hassles of dealing with the issue of gender altogether</em>.

            Compared to passive representations of characters in other entertainment mediums, the <a class="keyword" href="Immersion.html">immersive</a> element of video games leads to heightened, more acute <a class="keyword" href="ProteusEffect.html">real-world effects</a>.<sup><a href="#Fox">2</a></sup>:
            <br/><br/>
            Playing an immersive game featuring sexualized, negatively stereotyped and/or objectified female characters makes male players more likely to sexually harass women, express sexism, and accept myths about rape. Female players who encounter the same type of <a class="keyword" href="DiversityRepresentation.html">representations</a> of women feel less confident and less capable of achieving their goals. Players of all genders think women are less intellectually capable after playing a game that has such an unfavorable representation of women.<sup><a href="#Fox">2</a></sup>

            "Using avatars that conform to common racial stereotypes can intensify prejudicial attitudes."<sup><a href="#Jacobs">3</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            After playing video games in which black characters were perceived as violent, such as <i>Saints Row 2</i>, players are measurably more aggressive and have a higher measured level of implicit racism.<sup><a href="#Jacobs">3</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            This effect also occurs with players who encounter frequent portrayals of police brutality and of sexually objectified and stereotyped women in video games; they can become measurably more fearful of police and less respectful towards women over time.<sup><a href="#Jacobs">3</a></sup>
