            A study on the interaction between player gender, avatar gender and social
            communication and behavior in Massively Multiplayer Online (MMO) video games found

                <li>Women actually played more hours and more characters than men did.</li>
                <li>Women perceive that such games are “made” for men. </li>
                <li>Men often assume all other players are also men unless proven otherwise.
                    However, female players who do convince their male counterpart of their gender face
                    further discrimination.</li>
                <li>Male players will often downplay females’ abilities or engage in courtship.</li>
                <li>Much in the same way that men gender-bend to receive assistance, <em>women sometimes
                    report gender-bending to avoid the simple hassles of dealing with the issue of gender

            A recent study found that "using avatars that conform to common racial stereotypes can
            intensify prejudicial attitudes."<sup><a href="#Jacobs">3</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            After playing video games in which black characters were perceived as violent,
            such as <i>Saints Row 2</i>, study participants were found to be more aggressive and to have a
            higher measured level of implicit racism. <sup><a href="#Jacobs">3</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            The researcher, Jacobs, also noted that this effect can also be shown with
            players who encounter frequent portrayals of police brutality and of sexually
            objectified and stereotyped women in video games.<sup><a href="#Jacobs">3</a></sup>
            <br/><br/>
            Players of such games can become measurably more fearful
            of police and less respectful towards women over time.<sup><a href="#Jacobs">3</a></sup>
