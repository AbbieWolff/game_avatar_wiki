            Any action taken does not exist in the vacuum, so it is subject to social consequences.
            Generally, a negative consequence happens when people break *social norms*.
            Both social norms and subsequent social consequences depend on the community.
            <br/><br/>
            This is unsurprisingly similar to the real world; after all, virtual communities are
            simply way of interacting(Adrian).
            <br/><br/>
            Miscommunication is abundant because, without body language cues,
            itâ€™s more difficult to know whether someone is trustworthy. Because of this, trust and
            reputation are huge in MMOS.
            <br/><br/>
            *Anonymous* users may not see the social consequences of their actions or not care because
            they believe the consequences will not transfer to their *persistent identity*.
            However, anytime one interacts with a group, there is always a chance for consequence.
