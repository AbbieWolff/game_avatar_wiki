            Social rules for appropriate behavior that are formed by groups, communities, and cultures of people.

            Sometimes, social norms for virtual behavior can deviate from real-world social norms due to the nature of virtual environments and communities.

            Group identity can be strengthened when people wear similar clothing or styles.
            <br/><br/>
            Researchers sought to find out if being assigned similar-looking, or the same, avatars in virtual groups made users more or less likely to identify with their groups and to conform to group social norms in virtual environments. They found that:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Similarity increases virtual group identity
                </li>
                <li>
                    Differences in appearance decreases it
                </li>
                <li>
                    Helps people with diverse backgrounds get over their differences
                </li>
                <li>
                    Helps people identify with one another
                </li>
                <li>
                </li>
                    Decreases prejudice in interactions
            </ul>
            <br/><br/>
                    Virtual group identity can increase or decrease depending on the amount of similarity shared among group members and their inherent needs to be unique…. [S]haring the same self-representation in cyberspace [might] allow people from diverse... backgrounds to get over their differences, identify with one another, and even interact with one another without [as] much prejudice.<sup><a href="#Kim 2009">2</a></sup>

          Gender influences social behavior in virtual environments, as in the real-world.
          <br/><br/>
          In real life, most people identify as one gender and continue to present themselves as that gender in all facets of life. Their identity in the real world includes identifying with one static gender identity: male, female or a unique and equally legitimate variation upon these binary categories.
          <br/><br/>
          Conversely, in virtual worlds, it has become a social norm for some players of all genders to adopt an opposite-gender or non-gendered avatar.
          <br/><br/>
          Changes to <a class="keyword" href="AvatarAppearance.html">avatar appearance</a> can lead players to behave differently in virtual worlds. This is known as <a class="keyword" href="ProteusEffect.html">The Proteus Effect</a>.
          <br/><br/>
          In a study of the differences in social communication behaviors of male and female players who played opposite-gender avatars in online video games, Concordia University found that men reinforced idealized notions of feminine appearance and communication while playing as female game characters.<sup><a href="#Concordia">3</a></sup>
          <br/><br/>
          Gender and other forms of <a class="keyword" href="DiversityRepresentation.html">diversity representation</a> have noticeable effects upon numerous facets of gamers’ behavior--even subsequent real-world behaviors and attitudes.
