            <i>Social norms</i> are social rules for appropriate behavior that are formed by groups, communities,
            and cultures of people.
            <br/><br/>
            Sometimes, social norms for virtual behavior can deviate from real-world social norms
            due to the nature of virtual environments and communities.<sup><a href="Kim 2012">1</a></sup>

            Users who <a class="keyword" href="Identification.html">identify</a> with their

            Researchers sought to find out if being assigned similar-looking,
            or the same, avatars in virtual groups made users more or less
            likely to identify with their groups and to conform to group social norms in
            virtual environments. They found that similarity in virtual appearance among group members led to<sup><a href="">2</a></sup>:

            In real life, most people are expected to identify as one gender and continue to present themselves
            as that gender in all facets of life. Their identity in the real world is expected to include
            identifying with that one, relatively static gender identity: male, female, or another variation.
            <br/><br/>
            Conversely, in virtual worlds, it has become a social norm for some players (of
            all genders) to adopt an opposite-gender or non-gendered avatar.

            Such changes to <a class="keyword" href="AvatarAppearance.html">avatar appearance</a>

            Researchers studying the differences in social communication behaviors of
            male and female players who played opposite-gender avatars
            in online video games found that men
            reinforced idealized notions of feminine appearance and communication while
            playing as female game characters. <sup><a href="Concordia">3</a></sup>
