            Social rules for appropriate behavior that are formed by groups, communities,
            and cultures of people.

            Sometimes, social norms for virtual behavior can deviate from real-world social norms
            due to the nature of virtual environments and communities.<sup><a href="">1</a></sup>

            Group identity can be strengthened when people wear similar clothing or styles.
            Researchers sought to find out if being assigned similar-looking,
            or the same, avatars in virtual groups made users more or less
            likely to identify with their groups and to conform to group social norms in
            virtual environments. They found that:<sup><a href="">2</a></sup>

            In real life, most people identify as one gender and continue to present themselves
            as that gender in all facets of life. Their identity in the real world includes
            identifying with one static gender identity: male, female, or other variation.
            <br/><br/>
            Conversely, in virtual worlds, it has become a social norm for some players of
            all genders to adopt an opposite-gender or non-gendered avatar.

            Changes to <a class="keyword" href="AvatarAppearance.html">avatar appearance</a>
            can lead players to behave differently in virtual worlds. This is known as

            <br/><br/>
            In a study of the differences in social communication behaviors of
            male and female players who played opposite-gender avatars
            in online video games, Concordia University found that men
            reinforced idealized notions of feminine appearance and communication while
            playing as female game characters. <sup><a href="">3</a></sup>
